    "\n",
    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. \n",
    "It defines the characteristics and behaviors that objects of that class will have. A class is like\n",
    "a blueprint because it specifies what data the objects will hold (in the form of attributes or properties) \n",
    "and what operations can be performed on those objects (in the form of methods or functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. It is a concrete entity that is created based on the \n",
    "class definition. Objects have their own unique data and can perform actions defined by the class. They encapsulate\n",
    "both data and behavior."
